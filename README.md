I am trying to make an advanced version of notes app. Alongwith the basic notes app features this app "Moody" is also gonna have mood based note suggesting as the name suggests. I will not go into the details too much but will surely be back here and modify it all once i progress!

Here's a project summary (using ChatGpt)-


Moody is a minimalist, emotion-aware journaling app built natively in SwiftUI for iOS.  
What begins as a simple notes app transforms into a quiet bridge between people feeling the same — through shared moods, anonymous reflections, and moments of empathy.

---

## ✨ Features (v0.1)

- 📝 **Clean, distraction-free note writing**
- 🗂️ **Custom & premade mood tagging**
- 🔐 **Optional Face ID protection for privacy**
- 📚 **Organized note list with timestamp previews**
- ☁️ *(Coming soon)*: Mood-based anonymous note matching

---

## 🌱 Vision

Moody is not just a journaling tool. It's a place where:
- Feelings don’t get buried.
- Strangers become silent supporters.
- A note written at 2AM might reach someone who needed it at 4AM.

We’re building **an emotional safety net for Gen-Z and beyond** — one quiet note at a time.
